Some people call us 'old timers', some just say old...or maybe pioneers?  
My point is I know this area well and I love my city.  I've seen countless live bands here in Chicago, all kinds of genres. I've worked in the music scene and I know lots about what to do in Chicago and don't mind pointing you in the right direction for anything from shopping to entertainment, thrift stores, food, culture, acupuncture, spas, etc. I may even give you a ride there if I am not doing anything else that day.  

I thrive on art, music, architecture and designing my little house for the enjoyment of myself and my guests. I am pretty much always working on some project here (in my head or literally). I would say I am not a mainstream person and thus pretty open minded.  I am looking forward to meeting some fellow travelers and giving them a soft place to land for a few days!  I've really enjoyed meeting some guests already and look forward to more!
