Most recently I lived in Spain for 9 years and Ireland for 2 years but made my way back to US during the start of the pandemic to be closer to family. 

I'm an entrepreneur and adventurer, who loves hiking, doing sport, seeing live concerts, traveling, fighting for social causes and spending time with family and friends. Five things I can't live without are: Tacos, live music, traveling, hiking in mountains, and pickles. ;) 

I don't have a favorite travel destination per say (too many top trips) but in 2014 I traveled to Turkey and Greece. The history, beaches, food and culture were spectacular and I can't wait to go back! In 2019 I traveled through Thailand and I also loved it. There I explored the city, the jungle, the islands and even got my scuba diving certification. Most recently I traveled to Brazil for 3 weeks and fell in love with the people, the beaches and the caipis! 

When I travel I like to “live like the locals”, avoid tourist traps, be respectful of cultural norms/traditions, and travel sustainably. I like to have somewhat of a plan, but mostly go with the flow. I enjoy wandering markets, neighborhoods, parks, and seeing the places where the locals go, instead of running from one tourist attraction to another. 

I'm a super respectful guest and treat the places I stay as if they were my own! As a host, I'm extremely helpful, as I love to support people's travels and also promote positive multicultural interactions. I love getting to know other cultures- both the people and the places, respect differences and am curious about the nuances. 

My life motto? Practice gratitude and exercise compassion. Use this time on Earth to keep learning, helping others, and keep improving to become your best person possible.
